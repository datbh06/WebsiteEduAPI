# Website Edu Spring Boot Project

## Overview
This project is a Java Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for managing various entities, including BaiViet, ChuDe, DangKyHoc, HocVien, KhoaHoc, LoaiBaiViet, LoaiKhoaHoc, QuyenHan, TaiKhoan, and TinhTrangHoc. The application uses a MySQL database and includes service classes for performing CRUD operations on each entity.

## Getting Started
To set up this project locally, you'll need to have Java and Maven installed. You'll also need to have a MySQL database set up and running.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Update the `application.properties` file with the correct database connection information.
3. Run `mvn clean install` to build the project.
4. Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the application.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can use a tool like Postman or cURL to interact with the API. The available endpoints and their usage are documented in the code.
